<h1> Project 1: Colorizing early 20th century photography</h1>
<h3> Project Overview </h3>
<p> Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii was a Russian photographer who believed
    that color images were the future. Well ahead of his time, he envisioned a machine 
    that would be able to render color pictures from 3 filtered black-and-white ones 
    (one filtered red, another blue and another green). 
</p><p>
    For this reason, with the support of Emperor Nicholas II, he travelled all around 
    Russia taking these sets of three images in anticipation of the future. Unfortunately, 
    due to the Russian Revolution, and the time it took for technology to advance, he was
    never able to see the result of his work. 
</p><p>
    However, since most of the pictures ended in the US Library of Congress, today we're 
    able to revisit his work and generate color images from his work.
</p>
<h3> Solution Approach </h3>
<p> Here are some examples of the images we're working with: </p>
<section class="gallery">
    <img src="./originals/cathedral.jpg" alt="First Image">
    <img src="./originals/emir.jpg" alt="Second Image">
    <img src="./originals/train.jpg" alt="Third Image">
</section>

<p> The idea of this project is that we can use each filtered version of the image 
    as the channels R, G and B of a colored image, and thereby render a color image.
</p><p>
    The main challenge we need to resolve for this to work is that we must align the
    filtered pictures with each other. In order to do this (and since we observe that 
    no rotation is necessary) we can try different alignments and score them using L2 
    distance between the matrix of pixel intensities. While I briefly experimented with 
    other scoring metrics, L2 proved sufficient for our purposes. As a first approach 
    which worked for lower resolution images, it is sufficient to brute-force search 
    through possible alignments.  
</p>
<h4> Improvement 1: Pyramid Search for higher resolution images </h4>
<p> For high resolution images, exhaustively checking photo alignments for a range of 
    displacements isn't practical. For that reason, I implemented a pyramid search algorithm. 
    This means that images aren't aligned directly; rather, the image is first downsized until 
    it is small enough that we can do an exhaustive search that guarantees a correct alignment. 
    Then, this alignment information is used to align a higher resolution of the image, and this 
    process is repeated multiple times until we align the original picture. 
</p> 
<h4> Improvement 2: Cropping for better image alignment </h4>
<p> While the process described up to this point obtained good results for some images, 
    others has alignment problems due to the fact that borders contain unaccounted for noise. 
    For this reason, I decided to agressively crop the images before calculating optimal aligment 
    to avoid this noise. Specifically, I decided to use only the inner quarter of the image for aligment
    (i.e. I cropped by 25% on each edge). Here is an example of an improvement achieved through this change:

</section>
<h4> Improvement 3: Addressing the Emir picture </h4>
<p> The above procedure was enough to obtain good results for every image but that of the Emir of Bukhara.
    In the case of this specific picture, the brightness value of the red-filtered image is significantly different
    to both of the other channels. For this reason, the red filtered image was misaligned from the rest. To solve this,
    I used a sobel filter to preprocess images to edge version of themselves. By doing this, I was able to reduce
    the effect of the brightness difference to correctly align the emir picture. I also applied it to the rest by it
    didn't significantly improve my results. Here's the improvement achieved on the Emir of Bukhara.
